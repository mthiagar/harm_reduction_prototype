# Prototype for U Waterloo's HLTH 637
## Harm Reduction Map

This is a prototype of group 5's health system proposal. 
Details can be found in the proposal document submitted to Learn. 

This prototype displays a heatmap of sample data meant to represent densitity of total drug related reports to the Harm reduction Map app.
It shows:
* a heat map drug activity reports by geographic location (actual data is locations of traffic signals :) 
* a sample of user added markers with descriptions of drug related activity

Future functionality not added due to lack of time and/or skills:
* backend database to add persistance
* user input form to allow user input
* ability for user to click and add markers, or tag reports based on phone GPS location
Python and folium package was used to generated the map. 

Marker icons are from Fontawesome:
